As part of my college capstone project, I spent four months working to secure a small business network against a wide range of cybersecurity risks. 
The task involved securing a newly installed network by addressing areas like network security, compliance, threat prevention, data protection, and 
access control. I worked through planning, development, and evaluation stages, producing nearly 20,000 words of documentation. This project allowed 
me to apply my technical knowledge in a practical scenario, while developing my problem-solving and strategic thinking skills as I created a full 
security plan to protect the business against modern cyber threats.
